# Exercise-Work-with-optionals-in-Swift_coursera
Scenario
Suppose you are creating an app that requires a password and a passcode for users to sign in. To achieve this, you will use optionals, the forced unwrapping operator, and simple and multiple optional bindings to generate passcodes from passwords and check if the generated passcodes are valid.

  

Instructions
Create a new playground in Xcode to complete this exercise. Refer to the “How to complete exercises” reading to refresh your memory on creating and launching a new playground in Xcode. 

Once you have created a new playground, follow the steps below to create your very own password and passcode generator.
